Javascript practice!
using vanilla javascript with html/css, created a simple game where 4 "gems" are randomly assigned points. There will also be a randomly generated target points goal to achieve. Point of the game is to click on the 4 gems to reach the target points total, there may be times when that is not possible. But have fun!
